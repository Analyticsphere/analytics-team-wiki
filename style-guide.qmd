# c4cp Analytics Team code style for R

(Adapted from <https://style.tidyverse.org/)>

The [`styler`](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/styler-1.0.0/) package is highly recommended for automatically applying some (but not all) of the style recommendations here. `styler` is available as a stand-alone R package, but also comes with a handy RStudio add-in.

## Naming conventions

We use camel case for variabale names `varaibe_name`

Function names typically start with a verb. Variable names are typically nouns. Do not encode the data type in the variable names. Also, everything is data, so no need to say that unless unavoidable.

**Good**

-   The `fitOutcomeModel` function.
-   The `computeCovariateBalance` function.
-   The `population` argument.

**Bad**

-   `sampling` as variable name (not a noun)
-   `namesVector`, `covariatesDf` (encodes the data type)
-   `getResultData` (everything is data)
